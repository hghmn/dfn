# ultra-minimal-amd

Extremely basic implementation of a JavaScript AMD type loader

Does not yet fully implement the [AMD API as laid out here.](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api)

Inspired by other minimalist js projects:
- [140byt.es](http://140byt.es/)
- [when-then by geuis](https://github.com/geuis/when-then)
